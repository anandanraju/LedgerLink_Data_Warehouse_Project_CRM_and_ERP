# Ledger-Link Datawarehouse Project CRM & ERP

This Data Warehouse project has been designed using a **Medallion Architecture** approach to effectively manage, process, and organize information drawn from both 

* **CRM** (Customer Relationship Management)
* **ERP** (Enterprise Resource Planning)

The Medallion Architecture is structured into 

* **Bronze layer**
* **Silver layer**
* **Gold layer**

To ensures a systematic and scalable way to ingest raw data, refine and enrich it, and ultimately prepare it for analytics and business reporting.

I conceptualized and developed this project as part of my portfolio, aiming to strengthen my capabilities in both **Data Engineering** and **Data Analysis**. Through this project, I am building a foundation to accommodate future enhancements, allowing for continuous improvements and adjustments aligned with evolving business needs and technological advancements.

A significant future development planned for this system includes the creation of an **Interactive BI (Business Intelligence) Dashboard** using **Power BI** service. This dashboard will be designed to work seamlessly with the warehouse structure, offering a powerful visual layer that facilitates deeper insights into operational and customer data. By doing so, it will empower analysts to explore data trends, uncover actionable insights, and support strategic decision-making more efficiently.

Ultimately, this project serves not just as a technical showcase but as a dynamic platform for simulating **real-world data integration, transformation, and analytical processes**, demonstrating the importance of a well-architected data environment in driving business success.
